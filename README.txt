# Introduction

This is a simple to-do list app build in C# using Visual Studio. It allows you to
keep track of a list of current tasks and completed task, complete with saving/
loading.

# Usage

Download the files from the repository manually, or using the git terminal by typing

`git clone https://github.com/ryanjamesgalvin/todolist`

and run todolist.exe inside the /todolist/bin/release directory.

You can then type a task into the textbox on the left, and hit the Add button to add
the task to the current task queue. When a task is completed, you can hit the Complete 
button to move it to the completed tasks list. Hitting the clear button will clear the
list of completed tasks.

You can save/open a file (.txt extension) from the File menu; it will save both current
and completed tasks.
